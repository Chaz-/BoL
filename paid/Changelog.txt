Current known issues as of 6/8/2014 7:19PM EDT (GMT-5):
    Lulu:
        -VPrediction irelia message occasionally pops up after auth. This is a harmless issue and I think has to do with what the auth is returning (I share same auth platform with team funhouse, so that's probably why). I'm 99% sure this is irrelevant and you can safely ignore this message.
